# ðŸ¦€ My First Rust Program

**Started:** October 27, 2025 at 00:27 UTC+1

My very first Rust program, marking the beginning of my systems programming journey!

## What it does

Prints a personalized greeting in Rust, celebrating the start of my journey from Swift/iOS development into systems programming.

### Output

```
ðŸŽ‰ Hello, I'm Emilie! ðŸŽ‰
ðŸ¦€ Now coding in Rust!
ðŸ“± Swift âœ… â†’ ðŸ¦€ Rust âœ…
ðŸ’ª Date: October 27, 2025, 00:27 UTC+1
ðŸ”¥ Let's gooooo!
```

## Running it

```bash
cargo run
```

## The Code

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("ðŸŽ‰ Hello, I'm Emilie! ðŸŽ‰");
    println!("ðŸ¦€ Now coding in Rust!");
    println!("ðŸ“± Swift âœ… â†’ ðŸ¦€ Rust âœ…");
    println!("ðŸ’ª Date: October 27, 2025, 00:27 UTC+1");
    println!("ðŸ”¥ Let's gooooo!");
}
```

## Why Rust?

Coming from Swift and iOS development, I'm curious to explore the "other side"â€”how things work under the hood, memory management, ownership models, and performance-critical code.

**The journey from pixels to protocols begins now.** ðŸš€

## Next Steps

- [ ] Master Rust fundamentals (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes)
- [ ] Build more complex projects
- [ ] Explore distributed systems
- [ ] Contribute to open-source projects
- [ ] Dive deeper into systems programming

## Learning Resources

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) â€“ Official Rust documentation
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) â€“ Small exercises to learn Rust
- Lots of experimentation and debugging!

**Timeline:**
- **00:27 UTC+1, October 27, 2025** â€“ Installed Rust, compiled first program
- **More to come...**
